You know how Twitter started inserting others' favorites and
follows into your timeline? As it turns out, it's not an experiment -- it's official policy. We now know that the
social network recently updated its timeline explanation to confirm that it's adding tweets from strangers,
new accounts to follow and other "popular" content to your feed. Like you might have suspected, the company is trying
to make your stream "even more relevant and interesting" by showing you material you might not otherwise have seen.
